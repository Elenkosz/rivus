# rivus

rivus is a [mixed integer linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming) optimisation model for capacity planning for energy infrastructure networks. Its name, latin for stream or canal, stems from its origin as a companion model for [urbs](https://github.com/tum-ens/urbs), an optimisation model for urban energy systems. This model shares the same structure as urbs, so please refer to its introduction/tutorial for now or dive directly into the code.  

## Features

  * rivus is a mixed integer linear programming model for multi-commodity energy infrastructure networks systems with a focus on high spatial resolution.
  * It finds the minimum cost energy infrastructure networks to satisfy a given energy distribution for possibly multiple commodities (e.g. electricity, heating, cooling, ...).
  * Time is represented by a (small) set of weighted time steps that represent peak or typical loads  
  * Spatial data can be provided in form of shapefiles, while technical parameters can be edited in a spreadsheet.
  * The model itself is written using [Pyomo](https://software.sandia.gov/trac/coopr/wiki/Pyomo) and includes reporting and plotting functionality.

## Installation

### Windows

1. [**Anaconda (Python 3.6)**](http://continuum.io/downloads). Choose the 64-bit installer if possible.

2. **Pyomo** and **GLPK**
   1. Launch a new command prompt (Win+R, type "cmd", Enter)
   2. Type `conda install -c conda-forge pyomo glpk`, hit Enter.

3. Add **shapefile support**:
   ```
   conda install -c conda-forge pyshp shapely basemap
   ```

4. Get **geopandas** and its dependencies:
   ```
   conda install -c conda-forge pyproj fiona geopy geopandas
   ```

5. For interactive (3D) plots with **plotly**:
   ```
   pip install plotly
   ```
