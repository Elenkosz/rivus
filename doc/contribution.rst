Documentation
**************

Nobody can explain better what your code does than you.
The docstring in the source code are elementary, and I would not suppose anybody
would submit code without it...
But to make it easier for the next contributors, this online documentation is to be maintained as well.
Please take the time and jump into the following short tutorial and ensure the success of your contribution
with a nice documentation.
